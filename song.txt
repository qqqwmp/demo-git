A boy of anguish, now he's a man of soul
Traded in his misery for the lonely life of the road
The years were cruel to him
No, he won't let them go
Lays awake tryna' find the man inside to pack his bags and escape this world

I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't wanna do this anymore, I'm moving on
